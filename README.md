<h1 align="center">Stellar Rush</h1>
<p align="center">A simple endless runner game where the player controls a spaceship racing on a track to avoid obstacles and pick up power ups for more points.
<br /><br />
Developed on a custom game engine using C++ and OpenGL for the Computer Graphics module I did for my degree.
<br /><br />
Showcases usage of shaders, VAOs, VBOs, Catmull-Rom splines and other techniques.
